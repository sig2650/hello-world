An overview of the purpose of this acount

My purpose here is to encourage interest in the preservation of video game consoles based on the Signetics 2650 microprocessor.
In particular the group of clones related to the Voltmace Database: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1292_Advanced_Programmable_Video_System
This will be a repository of code, schematics, circuit board layouts etc related to the articles on my blog, https://sig2650.wordpress.com/

My work on this project is multi-faceted. You will (eventually) find:
    * Tutorials on programming the 2650 and the programmable video interface, the 2636.
    * Circuit schematics of the Voltmace Database.
    * Information that may help repair broken consoles.
    * Documentation of my 1982 game, Leapfrog.
    * New programs and games.
