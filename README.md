An overview of the purpose of this acount

My purpose here is to encourage interest in the preservation of video game consoles based on the Signetics 2650 microprocessor.
In particular the group of clones related to the Voltmace Database: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1292_Advanced_Programmable_Video_System .
This will be a repository of code, schematics, circuit board layouts etc related to the articles on my blog, https://sig2650.wordpress.com/.
All content may be freely used. Feedback is welcome, and I always like to meet other 2650 users. Links to my blog are really appreciated.

My work on this project is multi-faceted. You will (eventually) find:
    * Tutorials on programming the 2650 and the programmable video interface, the 2636.
    * Circuit schematics of the Voltmace Database.
    * Information that may help repair broken consoles.
    * Documentation of my 1982 game, Leapfrog.
    * New programs and games.
